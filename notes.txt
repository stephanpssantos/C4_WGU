Improvement ideas:
-add a human player
-add a way for it to read training_records.txt and create a records container
-add some sort of UI that lets you configure how to train
	-load the training records and see how it's done in the past
	-select one of the past models and train against it
	-select player types
	-select player config
	-select other config (game limit, win threshold, etc.)
	-select what happens if training model loses/wins
		-let user select from a list of possible behaviors
		-play against higher mcts level
		-play against self
		-play against lower mcts level (by how much?)
		-play against other models
	-configure number of training sessions to do
-try configuring MCTS versus other players (for the simulate stage)

When testing in JS:
npx http-server -o C:/Users/Stephan/source/GitHubPage/
http://192.168.0.20:8080/source/GitHubPage/stephanpssantos.github.io/c4/

Issues:
-needed to find swrast_dri.so using "find /usr -name swrast_dri.so"
-the error was telling me where it was looking for those files,
so after finding them I created a symlink to where it was being expected using 
"ln -s <actual location> <expected location>"

-needed to find libstdc++.so.6 using "find /usr -name libstdc++.so.6"
-The error here was more vague, it said "
libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to open swrast: /home/stephan/miniconda3/envs/ml_39/bin/../lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found (required by /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libLLVM-15.so.1) (search paths /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri:\$${ORIGIN}/dri:/usr/lib/dri, suffix _dri)
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)

 "
 
It was fixed by adding the path to libstdc++.so.6 to an environment variable called LD_PRELOAD
-run the following command or add it to the .bashrc file in your home directory
	export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
